"""Cheap import-time checks for the ``omnidreams`` plugin.

The full numerics / GPU tests live alongside this file (they need GPU
+ checkpoints). These smoke tests just confirm the plugin is wired
correctly: importable, public slugs map to their intended internal
pipeline presets, descriptions are non-empty, and the
entry-point declarations in ``pyproject.toml`` match the
``omnidreams.config`` ``RUNNER_*`` literals exactly.
